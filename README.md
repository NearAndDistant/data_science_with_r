## Registered Nurses (BLS)

"The Areas of the blue and red outline are measured from the centreas the common vertex.
The blue wedges measured from the centre of the circle represent area for area the median salary for nurses in each year (fig 1) and each state in 2021 (fig 2); & the red outline measures the mean.
We can see that across years there has been a close relationship between the median and mean for salaries. When we look at a state level we can see the sometimes large discrepancies in salaries although the close relationship between median and mean still hold.
Hawaii is an exception to the general rule where median salary is larger than mean, we could expect that some individuals in Hawaii earn a lot less than other, dragging the central tendancy of the mean downwards."[Code](https://github.com/NearAndDistant/data_science_with_r/blob/main/Tidy_Tuesday/2021/Week%2041%20:%20Registered%20Nurses/%5BCode%5D.Rmd)

## National Centre for Education Statistics (NCES)

This graphic shows the National Centre for Education Statistics' (NCES) data of Bachlor level graduations of white and black students in the United States between 1940 and 2016. Black graduate rates have always lagged behind white rates quite significantly, never reaching parity. This inequality is the result of intergenerational capital (both financial and social) as well as continued social divides causing an unequal network of opportunities. This continued division, unless intervened within, will continue to prevail within the US.[Code](https://github.com/NearAndDistant/data_science_with_r/blob/main/Tidy_Tuesday/2021/Week%2006%20:%20HBCU%20Foundation/%5BCode%5D.Rmd)

## NBER Papers

New research by NBER affiliates, circulated for discussion and comment. The NBER distributes more than 1,200 working papers each year. These papers have not been peer reviewed. Papers issued more than 18 months ago are open access. More recent papers are available without charge. This graphic clearly shows the trends towards Finance, Marcoeconomics and Microeconomics throughout the decades of publication.[Code](https://github.com/NearAndDistant/data_science_with_r/blob/main/Tidy_Tuesday/2021/Week%2040%20:%20NBER%20Papers/%5BCode%5D.Rmd)

## Emmy Awards
The two events with the most media coverage are the Primetime Emmy Awards and the Daytime Emmy Awards,\nwhich recognize outstanding work in American primetime and daytime entertainment programming, respectively.

## The Australian Bathing Birds Study

Bird baths are a familiar sight in Australian gardens but surprisingly little is known about the precise role they play in the lives of birds. 

In a dry continent such as Australia, bird baths may be vital to supporting an otherwise stressed bird population. Cleary et al (2016) wanted to find out more, so they enlisted the help of thousands of citizen scientists across Australia to gather as much data as they could on how birds use bird baths. And so the Bathing Birds Study was born. Started by researchers at Deakin University and Griffith University in 2014, this study involved collecting data online from 2,500 citizen scientists on bathing birds all over Australia in Winter 2014 and Summer 2015 (20 minutes, three times per week for four weeks).

Notable Winter saw more specific birds, the Noisy Miners, Magpies and Rainbow Lorikeets (see below) but Summer saw more overall bird species, Summer diversity is geographically mapped to the left showing the predominant species surveyed in each bioregion in Summer.

## The Duke Lemur Centre

The Duke Lemur Centre hosts the most diverse population of lemurs on Earth, outside their native Madagascar. Lemurs are the most threatened group of mammals on the planet, and 95% of lemur species are at risk of extinction. By studying variables that affect their health, reproduction, and social dynamics, the center learns how to most effectively focus their conservation efforts. Here we show the median life expectatcy of the largest 6 species. We can show using normalisation of species age at death and their distributions that between species 95% of Lemurs live between 2 months and 28 years (+/- 2 deviations).We can also see that 15% of the 2,872 Lemurs who have died at Duke's die under 6 months old.

## Kenya Census : Internet Access

The 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census was the eighth to be conducted since 1948 and was conducted from the 24th to 31st August 2019. Kenya leveraged technology to capture cartographic mapping, enumeration and data transmission, making the 2019 Census the first paperless census to be conducted in Kenya. Here we map internet usage across Kenya to show the low overall usage and vast disparities between counties (left) and between the sexes (right).

## Star Trek : Do Androids Dream of Stars

Using frequency analysis on Star Trek interactions we can analyse the different words Humanoids, Androids and Computers use in Star Trek. Using sentiment analysis we can see the android Data uses far less emotive words across all types of interactions with Computer than Humanoids\nor even Computer does. Using both Computer plots we can see that Computer uses a lot of negative sentiment and time words begging the question if Computer is a glorified clock.

## Bureau of Economic Analysis : Reporting on Infrastructure Spend

Infrastructure provides critical support for economic activity, and assessing its role requires reliable measures. This series of graphics provide an overview of U.S. infrastructure data in the National Economic Accounts. Data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) shows Investment in some important types of basic infrastructure has barely or not kept up with depreciation in recent decades (fig. a), though some sub-categories look better (fig. b) showing spend in real terms.

## Public Park Access : Linear Model of Trust for Public Land data

Since 2011, The Trust for Public Land (TPL) has kept track of green space availability across U.S. metros through the ParkScore index, which measures how well cities are meeting their residents’ green-space need based on five metrics: park access, acreage, investment, equity and amenities.

Even though we can measure against each seperate metric there is still no more powerful of a predictor than spend per resident ($) which when plotted on a logarithmic scale can predict 75% of the variance in\ntotal points (Adj. R Squared [mean of n = 2000 samples]) on our training cases and 79% on our test case.

### February 2021 : The Du Bois Challenge (BLM2021)

Challenge and context: [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-02-16/readme.md)

"One of the most powerful examples of data visualization was made 118 years ago by an all-black team led by W.E.B. Du Bois only 37 years after the end of slavery in the United States. “The Exhibit of American Negroes” was a sociological display at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris and was a collaboration by noted African-American sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois, educator and social leader Booker T Washington, prominent black lawyer Thomas J. Calloway and students from historically black college Atlanta University. Any African American to be admitted to Harvard University in 1888 had to be exceptionally gifted. But that description doesn’t come close to capturing the talent of WEB Du Bois, a man who managed to write 21 books, as well as over 100 essays while being a professor and a relentless civil rights activist. 

The goal of the challenge is to celebrate the data visualization legacy of W.E.B DuBois by recreating the visualizations from the 1900 Paris Exposition using modern tools."
