# FIPS
State	character	State name
FIPS	character	FIPS id (first two digits = state, last 3 digits = county)
DSCI	double	Drought Score (0 to 500) Zero means that none of the area is abnormally dry or in drought, and 500 means that all of the area is in D4, exceptional drought.
date	double	date in ISO
